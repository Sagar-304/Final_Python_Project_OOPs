# 🎓 Student Management System (Python – OOP Based)

This repository contains my **latest Python project: Student Management System**, developed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.  
The project is designed to manage student records efficiently through a simple and user-friendly console-based interface.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Student Management System** allows users to:
- Add new student records
- View all students
- Search for a specific student
- Update student details
- Delete student records
- Store and manage data efficiently

This project focuses on **clean structure, reusability, and real-world programming practices** using Python OOP principles.

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used

This project is fully based on **Object-Oriented Programming**, including:

- **Classes & Objects** – To represent students and the management system
- **Encapsulation** – Data and methods are bundled together
- **Constructors (`__init__`)** – To initialize student objects
- **Methods** – To perform CRUD operations
- **Modular Design** – Code is organized into multiple files for clarity
